### What is this?

This project implements a [Rewrite module](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite) that performs common tasks when migrating to new version of [Open Liberty](https://openliberty.io/).

Browse [a selection of recipes available through this module in the recipe catalog](https://docs.openrewrite.org/recipes/liberty).

## How to use?

To get a curated list of recipes based on the migration issues present in your applications, consider downloading the [Migration Toolkit for Application Binaries](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6250913) and then running an analysis scan against your applications. Documentation on how to run an analysis scan using the Migration Toolkit for Application Binaries can be found [here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/wamt?topic=binaries-detailed-migration-analysis-report)

For more info on using OpenRewrite, see the full documentation at [docs.openrewrite.org](https://docs.openrewrite.org/).
